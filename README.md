# A Comparative Analysis of Face Mask Detection Techniques

We explored a number of deep learning models for face-mask detection from three different perspectives (i.e., Baseline 1VGG, well-known VGG19 & ResNet50, and transfer learning) and evaluated their performances on two different datasets. We also evaluated the concept of domain adaptation for this task.


## Dataset
* Simulated Facemask dataset (SFMD) (https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net):<br>
The dataset is published by Cabani et al. It contains high resolution (1024Ã—1024) 67K simulated samples of people wearing mask correctly and incorrectly. The original images are collected from Flicker dataset. For our study, we randomly selected 6,442 masked images from SFMD and  6,442 unmasked images from the Flicker dataset.

* Real Facemask dataset (RFMD) (https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset):<br>
This is the biggest dataset of masked face for this problem. It consists of 90K images of 525 different people without masks and 6,442 images of real masked people. Among the masked images, many are from the same 525 people and some are different. To keep a balanced dataset, we used 6,442 masked and 6,442 unmasked images.
